Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling,
From glen to glen and down the mountain side;
The summer's gone, and all the leaves are falling;
'Tis ye, 'tis ye must go, and I must bide.

Love's sweet voice is calling yonder
Shine little glow-worm, glimmer, glimmer
Hey there, don't get dimmer, dimmer
Light the path below, above
And lead us on to love!
